# Predicting Rwanda CO2 Emission
This dataset is from Kaggle playground series S3E20.

Accurately tracking carbon emissions stands as a crucial measure in the battle against climate change. It provides invaluable insights for researchers and governments into the origins and trends of carbon output. While Europe and North America have robust systems for monitoring emissions on land, there's a significant scarcity of such systems across Africa. 
The challenge at hand involves developing machine learning models that leverage open-source data from Sentinel-5P satellite observations to forecast forthcoming carbon emissions. 


These solutions could prove instrumental in helping governments and various stakeholders estimate emission levels throughout Africa, particularly in areas where direct on-site monitoring remains unfeasible.

The dataset presents a time-series regression problem for predicting future CO2 emissions in Rwanda. Emission data is provided from 2019 to 2021.
 
The installed packages and environment is stored at rwanda_co2.yaml.
